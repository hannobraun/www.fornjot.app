Fornjot is an **early-stage CAD kernel**, using **boundary representation (b-rep)**, written in the Rust programming language.

As a CAD kernel, the project's main goal is to provide **a solid foundation for developers to build on top of**, whether for special purpose tooling, third-party libraries for extending Fornjot's feature set, or full-featured CAD applications.

In doing so, Fornjot follows these principles:

- Focus on **mechanical CAD applications**, like 3D printing, machining, woodworking; over other use cases such as architecture or electronics.
- Favor **reliability over features**. Anything you can do should either work as expected, or result in a clear and actionable error.
- Maintain **a friendly API for directly defining models** in Rust. This means code-first CAD modeling (or Code-CAD) is natively supported.
- Support **code-first CAD modeling in other languages**, by enabling third-party APIs.

Fornjot is still in development and doesn't always live up to these ambitions. None the less, these are the priorities the project follows.
