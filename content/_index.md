Fornjot is an **early-stage project** to create a **next-generation, code-first CAD application**.

![Screenshot of Fornjot](screenshot.png)

The **goal of this project** is to create a CAD application that:

- uses a **code-first** approach;
- is **open source**;
- is broadly available, with **support for all major platforms**;
- is based on a **new b-rep CAD kernel**, written in Rust;
- provides a **well-rounded feature set**;
- and support for **different modeling languages**.

This goal is not realized yet. Far from it, actually! But Fornjot is slowly getting better, step by step.
