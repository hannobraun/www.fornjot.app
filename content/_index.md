Fornjot is an **early-stage project** to create a **next-generation Code-CAD application**.

You might think, **what's the point?** Aren't there already plenty of options? Yes, but:

- Most are **based around complicated GUIs** that are hard to learn and can get in your way. Using a code-first approach is more powerful and, to the right user, more accessible.
- Those that are code-first mostly **lack any but the most basic features** for CAD modeling.
- Some have the features, but are **not approachable** to many users, due to a limited selection of modeling languages and hard-to-deal-with language environments.
- Commercial CAD applications are powerful, but also often **prohibitively expensive**. And no, "free for non-commercial use" doesn't count. There is lots of interesting space between "hobbyist" and "big yearly payment is no problem".
- Even if price is not an issue, does the CAD program you want to use **only run on Windows**? That can be very limiting.

The world truly needs another CAD program. And Fornjot's goal is to be that, by following these principles:

- **Write code to create flexible models:** CAD models in Fornjot are defined as code. Rust is supported as the modeling language, but Fornjot is architected to be language-agnostic.
- **Avoid repetitive work:** With the power of a programming language at your disposal, there's no reason to repeat yourself. Creating intricate models does not have to be a monotonous chore.
- **The right tool for your job:** At this early stage, Fornjot is still very limited. But it is architected from the ground up to be able to support even advanced CAD features.
- **Getting out of your way:** Fornjot's job is to assist you, by being available where you need it (with planned support for all major desktop and mobile platforms, and the web), being convenient to use, and providing the performance to support your workflow.
- **Free and open source:** Fornjot is open source software, available under a permissive license. Try it out for free, with no strings attached. Modify it to your needs. If it's useful to you, decide for yourself how you want to support its further development.

It's still early days, and it will take a long time before Fornjot can truly achieve this vision. Please consider supporting the project, by [helping out yourself](https://github.com/hannobraun/Fornjot) or [contributing financially](https://github.com/sponsors/hannobraun).
