Fornjot is an actively developed open source project with one full-time developer working on it. **To make that level of effort sustainable, Fornjot needs your help!**

If you want to see the goal of creating a next-generation, code-first CAD application realized, please consider supporting this effort. The long-term viability of Fornjot depends on people like you sponsoring its development. Whether you are willing to give a lot, or you can just spare a little, you can help!

Hey, it's me, [Hanno Braun](https://github.com/hannobraun), creator, maintainer, and main developer of Fornjot. I am accepting sponsorships to help me push the project forward. **Thank you for considering to help out!**

Let me try to answer some questions you might have while making your decision. If you have a question that is not covered here, please [feel free to contact me](mailto:hanno@braun-odw.eu)!


### Why sponsor?

I spend a lot of my time working on Fornjot. For years, on evenings and weekends, now as my main job. I am relying on sponsorship income to make this happen. Without sponsors, I wouldn't be able to keep it up.

Running an open source project is a lot of work. Besides writing code, I spend a lot of time on other activities:

- Planning, and opening issues to document these plans. This is necessary to help other developers to get involved, and to let users know where the project is going.
- Reviewing and merging pull requests. Fornjot can only thrive if others help out. Enabling them to do that is a priority.
- Marketing, like working on this website and publishing regular updates. Only if more people know about Fornjot, can it attract the developers and sponsors required to make it sustainable long-term.

I am in the fortunate position, than I can cover all my costs from sponsorship income, and I am very thankful to everyone who contributes! But my income is nowhere near what it could be, if I took a "real" job as a software developer somewhere. And I rely on very few sponsors, which is risky.

By pitching in, you make my income more stable, as well as help increase it to a more reasonable level. This will make Fornjot more viable long-term.


### What happens with the money?

Part of it covers business costs, like hosting, my internet connection, the computer I work on, etc. The rest of it goes to me as a salary. I also want to re-invest into Fornjot, by hiring others to help me out. So far, I don't make enough to feel comfortable doing that.

Since I am the maintainer of Fornjot, and at this point am still doing the large majority of the development work, supporting me directly is the best way to help the project.


### How does it work?

There are multiple ways to do it.

One is [GitHub Sponsors]. Head over to [my profile][GitHub Sponsors] and select one of the sponsorship tiers (or put in an arbitrary amount). You can choose a monthly contribution, which you can cancel any time, or opt for a one-time payment.

If you'd rather send cryptocurrency, I accept donations in literally dozens of them via NowPayments. Check out [my donation link][NowPayments], select a currency and amount using their widget, then send it to the address it displays.

Lastly, if you don't want to go through NowPayments, you can send Ether to this address: `0xC92aA208152D7e76Bb19cdC413d8F174eb2aEA92`

If none of these options work for you, [please let me know](mailto:hanno@braun-odw.eu). We can find a solution.


### How much does it costs?

The minimum contribution on GitHub Sponsors is $2, one-time or monthly. You can choose one of the tiers (see [my GitHub Sponsors profile][GitHub Sponsors]), or enter an arbitrary amount. Monthly sponsorships can be cancelled any time.

If you are [donating cryptocurrency via NowPayments][NowPayments], there is a minimum amount depending on the currency, current transaction fee, market situation, and other factors outside of my control.


### Are there any rewards?

All sponsorship tiers on [GitHub Sponsors] come with rewards. Every sponsor receives my monthly behind-the-scenes update, where I talk about how the project is going. Higher tiers come with more rewards, like your name or logo on the website, in the weekly release announcements, or the progress reports.

If you donated cryptocurrency, feel free to [contact me to claim a reward](mailto:hanno@braun-odw.eu).
