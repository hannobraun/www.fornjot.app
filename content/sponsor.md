Hey, it's me, [Hanno Braun](https://github.com/hannobraun), Fornjot's creator, maintainer, and main developer. I am accepting sponsorships to help me push the project forward. **Thank you for considering to help out!**

The long-term viability of Fornjot depends on people like you sponsoring its development. Whether you are willing to give a lot, or you can just spare a little, [you can help][GitHub Sponsors]. Even small contributions add up!


### Why sponsor?

I'm spending a lot of my time working on Fornjot. Previously on evenings and weekends, now as my main job. So far, I am mostly financing this work myself, by using up my savings. This can't go on forever.

Running an open source project is a lot of work. Besides writing code, I spend a lot of time on other activities:

- Planning, and opening issues to document these plans. This is necessary to help other developers get involved, and to let users know where the project is going.
- Reviewing and merging pull requests. Fornjot can only thrive if others help out. Enabling them to do that is a priority.
- Marketing, like working on this website and writing the Weekly Dev Log. Only if more people know about Fornjot, can it attract the developers and sponsors required to make it sustainable long-term.

I am very thankful to my current sponsors, but the amount I'm receiving right now is not enough. Sooner or later, I will have to take on contracting work (or even find a full-time job), to replenish my savings.

By pitching in, you enable me to spend more time on Fornjot.


### What happens with the money?

It goes directly to me, to help cover my bills. Starting with business costs, like hosting or my internet connection, then personal costs like health insurance, rent, and food. Once there is enough to cover that, I also want to re-invest some of it into Fornjot, by hiring others to help me out. But that is a far-off goal right now.

Since I am the maintainer of Fornjot, and at this point am still doing the large majority of the development work, supporting me directly is the best way to help the project.


### How does it work?

I am using [GitHub Sponsors] to receive sponsorship money. Head over to [my profile][GitHub Sponsors] and select one of the sponsorship tiers (or put in an arbitrary amount). You can choose a monthly contribution, which you can cancel any time, or opt for a one-time sponsorship.

If you can't, or don't want to, use GitHub Sponsors, [please let me know](mailto:hanno@braun-odw.eu). We can find a solution.

If you would like to sponsor me on another platform, please also let me know. I want to keep it simple for now, but if a lot of folks have the same preference, that is something I will try to accommodate.


### How much does it costs?

The minimum contribution is $2, one-time or monthly. You can choose one of the higher monthly tiers (see [my GitHub Sponsors profile][GitHub Sponsors]), or enter an arbitrary amount. Monthly sponsorships can be cancelled any time.

Even it you don't have much to give, every little bit helps. Small amounts add up to a meaningful contribution to my living costs!


### What do I get in return?

All the monthly sponsorship tiers come with rewards. Every sponsor receives my monthly update, where I talk about how the project is going, including behind-the-scenes stuff that I don't publish anywhere else. Higher tiers come with more rewards, like your name or logo on the website and in the Weekly Dev Log.

Check out [my GitHub Sponsors profile][GitHub Sponsors] for all the details.
