Hey folks!

My monthly update just went out to my sponsors. Topics include:

- How I made a wrong call that wasted a lot of work.
- What I'm doing to be better in the future.
- Update on the sponsorship income. Things are still tight, but there was some good news in October!

If you want to receive monthly behind-the-scenes updates too, why not support Fornjot by [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/hannobraun)? You can start with as little as $2 a month. More substantial contributions are also welcome, of course üòÅ

The sponsorship income has reached a point where it might be able to barely cover my costs (depending on how often unexpected problems like hardware failures happen). Since income and costs are so close, any new sponsorships are going to have an outsized impact on my ability to keep allocating regular time to Fornjot!


### Not receiving these updates?

I've been sending an update to my sponsors every month since February 2022. Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't give me a lot of insight into who is receiving them.

If you are a sponsor and haven't received those updates, maybe you are not opted in? Update your sponsorship over at GitHub, and make sure you check `Receive email updates from hannobraun`. Also make sure to check the spam folder in your email client.

If you still haven't received an update, [please contact me](mailto:hello@hannobraun.com). I'm happy to send you a copy directly.

I'm sorry for any inconvenience! I want to stay in touch with my sponsors, so if anything isn't working, please don't hesitate to reach out!
