Hey folks!

My monthly update just went out to my sponsors. Topics include:

- Reflecting on the ups and downs of recent months
- My new approach to manage energy and avoid burnout
- Update on the previous month's development
- Update on my not-quite-sustainable sponsorship income situation

If you want to receive monthly behind-the-scenes updates too, why not support Fornjot by [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/hannobraun)? You can start with as little as 2 USD a month. More substantial contributions are also welcome, of course üòÅ

I dedicate a substantial chunk of my week to working on Fornjot. Your contribution can help make that more sustainable.


### Not receiving these updates?

I've been sending an update to my sponsors every month since February 2022. Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't give me a lot of insight into who is receiving them.

If you are a sponsor and haven't received those updates, maybe you are not opted in? Update your sponsorship over at GitHub, and make sure you check `Receive email updates from hannobraun`. Also make sure to check the spam folder in your email client.

If you still haven't received an update, [please contact me](mailto:hanno@braun-odw.eu). I'm happy to send you a copy directly.

I'm sorry for any inconvenience! I want to stay in touch with my sponsors, so please don't hesitate to reach out, if anything's not working!
