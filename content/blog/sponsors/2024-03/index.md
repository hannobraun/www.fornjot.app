Hey folks!

My monthly update just went out to my sponsors. Topics include:

- The new formulation of Fornjot's goals went live.
- Two new 3rd-party projects building on Fornjot!
- Making progress on a layered data architecture.
- Outlook on what this new architecture can enable.
- Sponsorship income continues to grow.

If you want to receive monthly behind-the-scenes updates too, why not support
Fornjot by [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/hannobraun)? You can
start with as little as $2 a month. More substantial contributions are also
welcome, of course üòÅ

The sponsorship income has reached a point where it is barely enough to cover my
costs. Since income and costs are so close, any new sponsorships are going to
have an outsized impact on my ability to keep allocating time to Fornjot!

### Not receiving these updates?

I've been sending an update to my sponsors every month since February 2022.
Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't give me any insight into who is receiving them.

If you are a sponsor and haven't received those updates, maybe you are not opted
in? Update your sponsorship over at GitHub, and make sure you check
`Receive email updates from hannobraun`. Also make sure to check the spam folder
in your email client.

If you still haven't received an update,
[please contact me](mailto:hello@hannobraun.com). I'm happy to send you a copy
directly.

I'm sorry for any inconvenience! I want to stay in touch with my sponsors, so if
anything isn't working, please don't hesitate to reach out!
