Hey folks!

My monthly update just went out to my sponsors. Topics include:

- Taking a step back to look at the big picture. Where the project is coming from, where it's going.
- Update on sponsorship income. It's no longer enough to cover my costs.
- What's going to happen now, how long my runway is.

If you want to receive monthly behind-the-scenes updates too, why not support
Fornjot by [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/hannobraun)? You can
start with as little as $2 a month (most of my sponsors support me at $8 or $32). 

My sponsorship income has dropped below a sustainable level, but it's actually not too far from where it could cover my monthly costs again. **It won't take that many new sponsor to close the gap and minimize any disruption to the project.** If you've considered pitching in before, now is the time to do it!


### Not receiving these updates?

I've been sending an update to my sponsors every month since February 2022.
Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't give me any insight into who is receiving them.

If you are a sponsor and haven't received those updates, maybe you are not opted
in? Update your sponsorship over at GitHub, and make sure you check
`Receive email updates from hannobraun`. Also make sure to check the spam folder
in your email client.

If you still haven't received an update,
[please contact me](mailto:hello@hannobraun.com). I'm happy to send you a copy
directly.

I'm sorry for any inconvenience! I want to stay in touch with my sponsors, so if
anything isn't working, please don't hesitate to reach out!
