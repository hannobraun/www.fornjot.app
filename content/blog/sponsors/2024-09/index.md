Hey folks!

My monthly update just went out to my sponsors. Topics include:

- An important request for feedback.
- Thinking about the project's direction, beyond the technical roadmap.
- How to make Fornjot successful, given the limited resources available.
- Update on sponsorship income.

If you want to receive monthly behind-the-scenes updates too, why not support
Fornjot by [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/hannobraun)? You can
start with as little as $2 a month (most of my sponsors support me at $8 or $32). 

Sponsorship income is currently at the point were I'm bleeding money, slowly. _Very_ slowly, but still. **If you want to save me from gradually depleting my saving to work on open source, why not become a new sponsor?** This could also take some burden off my very generous existing sponsors!


### Not receiving these updates?

I've been sending an update to my sponsors every month since February 2022.
Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't give me any insight into who is receiving them.

If you are a sponsor and haven't been getting those updates, maybe you are not opted
in? Update your sponsorship over at GitHub, and make sure you check
`Receive email updates from hannobraun`. Also make sure to check the spam folder
in your email client.

If you still haven't received an update,
[please contact me](mailto:hello@hannobraun.com). I'm happy to send you a copy
directly.

I'm sorry for any inconvenience! I want to stay in touch with my sponsors, so if
anything isn't working, please don't hesitate to reach out!
