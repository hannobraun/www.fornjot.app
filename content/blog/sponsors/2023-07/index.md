Hey folks!

I just sent out the new sponsor update! Topics this month include:

- Good news on the development of my sponsorship income.
- Progress update on Fornjot's development.
- What I expect to work on for the foreseeable future.

If you want to receive monthly behind-the-scenes updates too, why not support Fornjot by [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/hannobraun)? You can start with as little as 2 USD a month. More substantial contributions are also welcome, of course üòÅ

I dedicate a substantial chunk of my week to working on Fornjot. Your contribution can help make that more sustainable.


### Not receiving these updates?

I've been sending out an update every month since February 2022. If you are a sponsor and haven't received those updates, maybe you are not opted in? Update your sponsorship over at GitHub, and make sure you check `Receive email updates from hannobraun`. Also make sure to check the spam folder in your email client.

If you still haven't received an update, [please contact me](mailto:hanno@braun-odw.eu). I'm happy to send you a copy directly.

I'm sorry for any inconvenience! Unfortunately, GitHub gives me no control over, or insight into, who is receiving those updates.
