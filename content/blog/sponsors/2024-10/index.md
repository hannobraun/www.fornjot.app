Hey folks!

My monthly update just went out to my sponsors. Topics include:

- Conclusions from the feedback I received.
- The plan I developed from that, initially.
- Why that wouldn't work.
- A gloomy outlook for the project.
- Update on sponsorship income.

If you're curious about the specific details about the gloomy outlook, you can [become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/hannobraun) and [request access to this update](mailto:hello@hannobraun.com). (You'll receive future updates automatically, if you opt in. See below for details.)


### Not receiving these updates?

I've been sending an update to my sponsors every month since February 2022.
Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't give me any insight into who is receiving them.

If you are a sponsor and haven't been getting those updates, maybe you are not opted
in? Update your sponsorship over at GitHub, and make sure you check
`Receive email updates from hannobraun`. Also make sure to check the spam folder
in your email client.

If you still haven't received an update,
[please contact me](mailto:hello@hannobraun.com). I'm happy to send you a copy
directly.

I'm sorry for any inconvenience! I want to stay in touch with my sponsors, so if
anything isn't working, please don't hesitate to reach out!
