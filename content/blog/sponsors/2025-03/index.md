Hey folks!

The monthly update for my sponsors just went out. Topics include:

- Breakthrough in the ongoing experiment!
- Outlook on what's next.
- The experiment will conclude shortly, a new one will start then.
- A closer look at an improvement that contributed to the breakthrough.
- A setback on sponsorship income.

If you want to receive monthly behind-the-scenes updates too, why not support
Fornjot by [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/hannobraun)? You can
start with as little as $2 a month (most of my sponsors support me at $8 or above).

Thanks to my sponsors, I can cover my (very modest) cost of living, which allows me to dedicate a significant portion of my time to Fornjot. **With your help, it's much more likely I can keep doing that**. Your support could also take some burden off my existing sponsors, many of which very generously support me with $32 or $128 a month, and beyond!


### Not receiving these updates?

I've been sending an update to my sponsors every month since February 2022.
Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't give me any insight into, or control over, who is receiving them.

If you are a sponsor and haven't been getting those updates, maybe you are not opted
in? Update your sponsorship over at GitHub, and make sure you check
`Receive email updates from hannobraun`. Also make sure to check the spam folder
in your email client.

If you still haven't received an update,
[please contact me](mailto:hello@hannobraun.com). I'm happy to send you a copy
directly.

I'm sorry for any inconvenience! I want to stay in touch with my sponsors, so if
anything isn't working, please don't hesitate to reach out!
