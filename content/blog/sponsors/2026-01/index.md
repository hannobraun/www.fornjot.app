Hey folks!

The monthly update for my sponsors just went out. Topics include:

- I'm more excited and optimistic than I've been in years!
- Two approaches to geometry representation that are both problematic.
- The third approach I came up with, that might solve the problems of both.
- Started prototyping that in yet another experiment; so far it's going great.
- What this could mean for the future of Fornjot.
- An update on my sponsorship income.

If you want to receive monthly behind-the-scenes updates too, why not support
Fornjot by [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/hannobraun)? You can
start with as little as $2 a month (most of my sponsors support me at $8 or above).

These days, my sponsorship income hovers around, or slightly below, the point where it can cover my costs. This works for now, but **with no surplus, this is not sustainable long-term**. Every new sponsor makes a big difference!

### Not receiving these updates?

I've been sending an update to my sponsors every month since February 2022.
Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't give me any insight into, or control over, who is receiving them.

If you are a sponsor and haven't been getting those updates, maybe you are not opted
in? Update your sponsorship over at GitHub, and make sure you check
`Receive email updates from hannobraun`. Also make sure to check the spam folder
in your email client.

If you still haven't received an update,
[please contact me](mailto:hello@hannobraun.com). I'm happy to send you a copy
directly.

I'm sorry for any inconvenience! I want to stay in touch with my sponsors, so if
anything isn't working, please don't hesitate to reach out!
