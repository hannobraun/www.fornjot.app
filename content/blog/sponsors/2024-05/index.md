Hey folks!

My monthly update just went out to my sponsors. Topics include:

- Sponsorship income dropped, is going to drop more!
- How I plan to address this.
- What this means for the future of the project.

If you want to receive monthly behind-the-scenes updates too, why not support
Fornjot by [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/hannobraun)? You can
start with as little as $2 a month. More substantial contributions are also
welcome, of course üòÅ

Unfortunately I've recently had some bad news about my sponsorship income. As things stand now, I'll no longer be able to support myself starting July. If you've been on the fence about supporting my work, now's the time to reconsider! With your support, there's hope I can continue my work uninterrupted.

### Not receiving these updates?

I've been sending an update to my sponsors every month since February 2022.
Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't give me any insight into who is receiving them.

If you are a sponsor and haven't received those updates, maybe you are not opted
in? Update your sponsorship over at GitHub, and make sure you check
`Receive email updates from hannobraun`. Also make sure to check the spam folder
in your email client.

If you still haven't received an update,
[please contact me](mailto:hello@hannobraun.com). I'm happy to send you a copy
directly.

I'm sorry for any inconvenience! I want to stay in touch with my sponsors, so if
anything isn't working, please don't hesitate to reach out!
