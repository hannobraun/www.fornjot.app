Hey folks!

My monthly update just went out to my sponsors. Topics include:

- What I've been working on. Significant progress this month!
- What I want to work on next, and how that's going to enable much better modeling than we've had until now.
- How sponsorship income developed this month, and what I'm doing to make the situation more sustainable.

If you want to receive monthly behind-the-scenes updates too, why not support Fornjot by [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/hannobraun)? You can start with as little as $2 a month. More substantial contributions are also welcome, of course üòÅ

I'm getting really close to the point, where my sponsorship income can cover my monthly costs. If you want to make a real difference, now is the time!


### Not receiving these updates?

I've been sending an update to my sponsors every month since February 2022. Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't give me a lot of insight into who is receiving them.

If you are a sponsor and haven't received those updates, maybe you are not opted in? Update your sponsorship over at GitHub, and make sure you check `Receive email updates from hannobraun`. Also make sure to check the spam folder in your email client.

If you still haven't received an update, [please contact me](mailto:hello@hannobraun.com). I'm happy to send you a copy directly.

I'm sorry for any inconvenience! I want to stay in touch with my sponsors, so please don't hesitate to reach out, if anything isn't working!
