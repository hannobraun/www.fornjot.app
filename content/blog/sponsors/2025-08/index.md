Hey folks!

The monthly update for my sponsors just went out. Topics include:

- Good news!
- Why I hoped to have _great_ news instead.
- How development is going these days, and what could come next.
- An update on my sponsorship income. (That's the good news.)

If you want to receive monthly behind-the-scenes updates too, why not support
Fornjot by [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/hannobraun)? You can
start with as little as $2 a month (most of my sponsors support me at $8 or above).

It's thanks to my sponsors, that I can continue to dedicate time to Fornjot almost every day. **With your help, it's much more likely I can keep doing that.** These days, sponsorship is right around the point where it covers my costs. Every little bit more would help me a lot!


### Not receiving these updates?

I've been sending an update to my sponsors every month since February 2022.
Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't give me any insight into, or control over, who is receiving them.

If you are a sponsor and haven't been getting those updates, maybe you are not opted
in? Update your sponsorship over at GitHub, and make sure you check
`Receive email updates from hannobraun`. Also make sure to check the spam folder
in your email client.

If you still haven't received an update,
[please contact me](mailto:hello@hannobraun.com). I'm happy to send you a copy
directly.

I'm sorry for any inconvenience! I want to stay in touch with my sponsors, so if
anything isn't working, please don't hesitate to reach out!
