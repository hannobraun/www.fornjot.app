Hey folks!

My monthly update just went out to my sponsors. Topics include:

- This one's late. Sorry!
- Positive developments after last month's update.
- Sponsorship income still on track to drop below sustainable level.

If you want to receive monthly behind-the-scenes updates too, why not support
Fornjot by [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/hannobraun)? You can
start with as little as $2 a month (most of my sponsors support me at $8 or $32). 

Despite some positive developments, my sponsorship income is still on track to drop below a sustainable level, where it would be enough to cover my living costs. **If you've been on the fence about supporting my work, now's the time to reconsider!** Every additional sponsor reduces the amount of interruption to the project, from me having to find client work to support myself.

### Not receiving these updates?

I've been sending an update to my sponsors every month since February 2022.
Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't give me any insight into who is receiving them.

If you are a sponsor and haven't received those updates, maybe you are not opted
in? Update your sponsorship over at GitHub, and make sure you check
`Receive email updates from hannobraun`. Also make sure to check the spam folder
in your email client.

If you still haven't received an update,
[please contact me](mailto:hello@hannobraun.com). I'm happy to send you a copy
directly.

I'm sorry for any inconvenience! I want to stay in touch with my sponsors, so if
anything isn't working, please don't hesitate to reach out!
