[Fornjot](https://www.fornjot.app/) is a project to create a next-generation Code-CAD application. This is Fornjot's Weekly Dev Log, a summary of the previous week's development activities.

This is also the first Weekly Dev Blog for Fornjot ever! Please bear with me, as I figure out a good format for these things over the next few weeks.
