Last week saw lots of small, user-visible improvements to the app. Anti-aliasing, various fixes to the GUI, replacing weird crashes with good error messages, and maybe most significantly, the ability to load a model from within the app, instead of having to provide it as a command-line argument (contributed by [@erenoku]).

Meanwhile my work on advancing the core CAD features is trucking along, although at a slower pace than hoped (isn't it always ðŸ˜„). As a reminder, my main priority is the implementation of the union operation ([#42]), which is currently blocked by a bug ([#1162]). I've been making some progress on improving the validation infrastructure in the kernel, which should allow me to attack the bug itself soon.
