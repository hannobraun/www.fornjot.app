What's this, another Tuesday release? Yeah, I'm sorry. This time, a public holiday was to blame. I happened to be out hiking for most of Monday, so no time to publish a release, really üòÅ

Not much else to say this week. [#1713](https://github.com/hannobraun/Fornjot/issues/1713) is inching along. No great problems, nor any great breakthroughs. You, you know, work.

Meanwhile, [@A-Walrus] found and fixed an issue in the documentation, which is always very welcome!
